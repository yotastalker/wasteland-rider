# No external dependencies required
# Python 3.7+ standard library only

# The game uses only built-in Python modules:
# - json (for world data and save files)
# - os (for file operations)
# - pickle (for save functionality)
# - random (for encounters and events)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - dataclasses (for data structures)
# - enum (for game states)
